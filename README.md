### The Thing I Wish I Knew

This is a repository of resources that are helpful mainly for computer science but for programming as well. This README is going to be a guide to digesting and exploring the resources. There will also be a section talking about what I wish had been explained to me when I first started branching into the world of software and hardware beyond just being a "user".
