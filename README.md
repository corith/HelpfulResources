### The Thing I Wish I Knew

This is a repository of resources that are helpful mainly for computer science but also for programming in general. This README is going to be a guide to digesting and exploring the resources. 

* it is currently just a resource dump - I do plan on organizing it better at some point in the future.


- Tech staples are technical papers written about big O, memeroy, etc.
- Operating system folder contains OS text books and papers as well as stuff talking about general file systems. 
- Anything not in specific folder is just random resources.
